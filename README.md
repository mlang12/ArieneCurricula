# Curricula

## What is the best way to learn something?
This website was designed to answer the question "what is the best way to learn something?" Users can create and view curricula created by the community to learn all sorts of different things, from how to learn JavaScript to how to learn to surf. Users can then vote on the curricula that best helped them learn and the natural best ways to learn will rise to the top.
